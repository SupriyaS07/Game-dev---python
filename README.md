# Game-dev---python
Task 1: Build Tic Tac Toe game: I started by implementing the core game   logic using a 2D list, 
handling user inputs, checking for win/draw conditions, adding three different levels and later 
building a simple graphical interface using tkinter. This task taught me about control flow, modular 
programming, and GUI basics.  

Task 2: Build a Quiz game: This is a Python quiz application built with Tkinter that tests users' Python 
knowledge through multiple-choice questions across Easy, Intermediate, and Hard levels. It features a clean 
GUI, countdown timer, score tracking, and background music using Pygame, offering an engaging and 
interactive experience.  

Task 3: Build a Snake game: where I implemented continuous snake movement, food generation, and 
self-collision logic. The snake would grow with each food item consumed, and the game included a 
scoring system and speed increase to raise difficulty. This project deepened my understanding of 
realtime updates, dynamic list management, and efficient collision handling.  

Task 4: Build a Connect 4 game: I designed a 6x7 grid structure and implemented logic to drop tokens 
into the grid, alternating turns between two players. Using pygame, I created an interactive interface 
with animated tokens and win condition checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal alignments. This 
task enhanced my skills in grid-based logic, pattern detection, and graphical rendering.
